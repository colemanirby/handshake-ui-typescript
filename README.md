# handshake-ui-typescript
Just the handshake-ui component crudely translated into TypeScript

If you really want to run it the go ahead.  

npm install and you're good to run npm run start or whatever

It doesn't look as good codewise nor visually.

I'm checking out ESLint instead of TSLint + TypesScript.  I like the flow of React and Typescript makes it feel too rigid.
